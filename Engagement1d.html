<b> What I like to do</b>
</br>
</br>
I have always loved morning runs, especially when I run with my dad. 
</br>
</br>
<b> Why running? </b>
</br>
</br>
The nature is a good giver of oxygen and vitamins in the body. When I run I feel energized and ready for the day.

<b>My influences</b>
<ol>
	<li>My parents has always been my biggest cheerer when it comes to our health in the family. I grew up with asthma and therefore has a weak lungs. Sure, medicine helps but making my body healthy will make me live more longer :) My dad would always make me practice breathing exercises to make my lungs strong. I remember, before I went to leave for mission he would come with me and run on days that he isn't working.  </li>
	<li>My mission companions has always been hard worker and great at exercising so we would encourage each other to run every morning for 30 minutes non-stop. It felt tiring but refreshing. It made us stronger and healthier as we go out and serve the people for the rest of our days.</li>

<b>Experience</b>
</br>
</br>
When I was on my last year in grade schooling first year of high school, I joined the track and field sports in school. I really enjoyed it. But I didn't end up competing for the regional because of health issues but I have always loved seeing my co-runners win the race. It was one of the most fulfilling feeling in school. I am glad that I am still able to continue to run util now. Laie is such a great place to run especially in the morning.
